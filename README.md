# Medical Imaging - Kidney Disease Classification Using Deep Learning


## Objective

Develop an automated deep learning pipeline that classifies kidney conditions from medical images using advanced preprocessing techniques (enhancement and degradation) to improve diagnostic accuracy.

---

## Introduction

Medical image quality inconsistencies (noise, low contrast, blur) impact accurate kidney disease diagnosis. This project tackles such issues with:

- Enhancement techniques (CLAHE, sharpening)
- Degradation simulations (blur, noise)
- Custom CNN and ResNet50 models
- Performance evaluations under various conditions

## Dataset & Preprocessing

**Classes:** Normal, Stone, Cyst, Tumor  
**Versions Created:** Enhanced, Degraded

### Preprocessing Steps:

1. **Noise Reduction**  
   - Gaussian Blur  
   - Median Filtering  

2. **Contrast Enhancement**  
   - CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization)  

3. **Sharpening and Edge Enhancement**  
   - Unsharp Masking  
   - Laplacian Filters  

4. **Image Degradation (Controlled Distortion)**  
   - Blur  
   - Contrast Reduction  
   - Noise Addition  

5. **Denoising and Restoration**  
   - Adaptive Median Filtering  
   - Non-Local Means Denoising  

6. **Normalization**  
   - Rescaling (0â€“1 range for FastAI)  
   - `preprocess_input` for TensorFlow

## Methodology

### 1. Dataset Organization
- Structured into `train/`, `val/`, `test/` with class-wise folders.

### 2. Image Enhancement
- Applied CLAHE, Gaussian blur, sharpening, and Laplacian filters.

### 3. Image Degradation
- Simulated low-quality images with noise, blur, and contrast reduction.

### 4. Deep Learning Models

#### A. Custom CNN (FastAI)
- 2 Conv layers + Pooling + Dense + Dropout + ReLU  
- Trained for 5 epochs (LR = 3e-3)

#### B. ResNet50 (TensorFlow + Transfer Learning)
- `include_top=False` with custom classification layers  
- Frozen base, augmented images using `ImageDataGenerator`

### 5. Evaluation
- Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix  
- Visual performance plots generated
